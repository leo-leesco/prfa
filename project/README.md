# Project report

## Build

Simply run `make` at the top level.

`make clean` works very nicely to solve any Rocq version mismatch related issue.

## Help

I kindly thank Arthur Adjedj, Loïc Chevallier, Virgile Marionneau and Wassel Bousmaha for their help with various questions.

For the first three, every time they helped me, there is a comment in the code. You will find them at the following places :
- Virgile Marionneau 
    - `Weak_ctx_syntactic`
    -  `WeakeningCF` and `WeakeningAE`
- Loïc Chevallier
    - `absurd_dne_ae`
    - `false_dne`
- Arthur Adjedj
    - `SN_app`
    - `Kmodel`

For Wassel, we both agree that we do not remember very precisely on what he helped me with. It is clear he helped me with the Friedman lemmas, however I can't remember exactly what. I think it was a definition problem of sorts…

## Previous experience

I have never worked with Rocq before, and this project was extremely interesting and useful for my understanding of the syntax and inner workings of the language ! Very fun and I'd like to carry on using it.

I have used Agda in the past (S. Mimram's course at l'X).

## Stuck

I got stuck mostly on the last questions for lack of time, not understanding precisely what was going on… There are a few in this case at the end with little to no body : lack of time.
