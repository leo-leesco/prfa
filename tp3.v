Axiom REPLACE_ME : forall {A : Type}, A.

(** EXERCISE

  Prove the following statements using proof terms.
  If it's too hard to do directly, you can use the interactive mode together
  with the [refine] tactic.

**)

Definition ex1 : forall (P Q : Prop), P -> Q -> P :=
  fun P Q p q => p.

Definition ex2 : forall (P Q R : Prop), P -> (P -> Q) -> (P -> Q -> R) -> R :=
  fun P Q R p pq pqr => pqr p (pq p).

(** We give you this type for "lower than" (lt). **)

  fun xnx => (proj1 xnx) ((proj2 xnx) (fun x => (proj1 xnx) x x)) ((proj2 xnx) (fun x => (proj1 xnx) x x)).

(** Impredicative encodings

  Thanks to impredicativity of [Prop] (the ability to quantify over
  propositions within propositions) it is possible to define most connectives
  using only [forall] and [->] (no inductive definitions).

  For instance, one can define [False] as follows:

**)

Definition iFalse := forall (P : Prop), P.

(** EXERCISE

  Show that [iFalse] is equivalent to [False].

**)
Lemma iFalse_iff : False <-> iFalse.
Proof.
  split.
  - intro ff. exfalso. assumption.
  - intro iF. apply iF.
Qed.

(** EXERCISE

  Define the impredicative encoding of [True] and show it equivalent to [True].

**)

Definition iTrue : Prop :=
  forall (P : Prop), P -> P.

Lemma iTrue_iff : True <-> iTrue.
Proof.
  split.
  - intro t. intro P. intro p. assumption.
  - intro iT. split.
Qed.

(** EXERCISE

  Now do the same thing for conjunction, disjunction and the existential
  quantifier.

**)

Definition iAnd (P Q : Prop) : Prop :=
  forall (R : Prop), (P -> Q -> R) -> R.

Lemma iAnd_iff :
  forall P Q,
    P /\ Q <-> iAnd P Q.
Proof.
  split.
  - intros [p q] R PQR. apply PQR; assumption.
  - intro iA. split.
    + apply iA. intros p q. assumption.
    + apply iA. intros p q. assumption.
Qed.

Definition iOr (P Q : Prop) : Prop :=
  forall (R : Prop), (P -> R) -> (Q -> R) -> R.

Lemma iOr_iff :
  forall P Q,
    P \/ Q <-> iOr P Q.
Proof.
Admitted.

Definition iEx (X : Type) (P : X -> Prop) : Prop :=
  REPLACE_ME.

Lemma iEx_iff :
  forall X P,
    (exists (x : X), P x) <-> iEx X P.
Proof.
Admitted.

(** Advanced exercises **)

(** Mutual inductive types

  It is also possible to define several inductive types at the same time.
  You just combine them with the [with] keyword.

  This way we can define the type of trees mutually with that of forests
  (which are basically lists of trees).

**)

Inductive ntree (A : Type) :=
| nnode : A -> nforest A -> ntree A

with nforest (A : Type) :=
| nnil : nforest A
| ncons : ntree A -> nforest A -> nforest A.

(** You can then define mutual definitions over such types by using [Fixpoint]
  and the [with] keyword.
**)

Fixpoint count {A} (t : ntree A) {struct t} : nat :=
  match t with
  | nnode _ a l => 1 + count_list l
  end

with count_list {A} (l : nforest A) {struct l} : nat :=
  match l with
  | nnil _ => 0
  | ncons _ t tl => count t + count_list tl
  end.

(** EXERCISE

  Define a map function for [ntree].
  Hint: You probably will have to change [Definition] into something else.

**)

Definition ntree_map {A B} (f : A -> B) (t : ntree A) : ntree B :=
  REPLACE_ME.

(** Nested inductive types

  Finally, you can define more inductive types by using what is called nesting.
  In the type below, you define a tree as something that contains a list of
  trees.

**)

Inductive tree :=
| N (ts : list tree).

(** EXERCISE

  Can you give an element of type [tree]?

**)


Definition ex4 : tree :=
  REPLACE_ME.

Inductive All {X} (P : X -> Type) : list X -> Type :=
| All_nil : All P nil
| All_cons x l : P x -> All P l -> All P (x :: l).

Arguments All_nil {X P}.
Arguments All_cons {X P}.

Fixpoint tree_rect_strong (P : tree -> Type)
    (f : forall (ts : list tree), All P ts -> P (N ts))
    (t : tree) : P t :=
  let fix F ts : All P ts :=
    match ts with
    | [] => All_nil
    | t' :: l => All_cons _ _ (tree_rect_strong P f t') (F l)
    end
  in
  match t with
  | N ts => f ts (F ts)
  end.

(** EXERCISE

  - Extend the type [tree] to have labelled nodes.
  - Prove a bijection between the new [tree] and [ntree],
    ie. define functions
    to_tree : forall A, ntree A -> tree A
    from_tree : forall A, tree A -> ntree A
    and show that they invert each other.

**)

(** Here is the Fibonnaci function.

  Notice the [as] keyword to give a name to subexpression [S n].
  This way Coq knows that [S n] is a subterm of the one we started with.

**)

Fixpoint fib n : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 | 1 => 1
  | S (S n as m) => fib m + fib n
  end.

(** EXERCISE

  Define the Fibonnaci function [fib] using [nat_rect] directly.

**)

(** EXERCISE

  Define it using course-of-values recursion, a form of strong induction shown
  below.
  Of course you need to prove [brec] first.

**)

Fixpoint below (P : nat -> Type) (n : nat) : Type :=
  match n with
  | 0 => unit
  | S n => P n * below P n
  end.

Compute below _ 5.

Fixpoint brec' (P : nat -> Type)
  (F : forall n', below P n' -> P n') (n : nat) {struct n} : P n * below P n :=
  REPLACE_ME.

Definition brec {P : nat -> Type}
  (F : forall n, below P n -> P n) : forall n, P n :=
  REPLACE_ME.

(** Inconsistencies

  There are three crucial potential breaking points ofconsistency of type
  theory:
  - termination of recursive functions, which needs to be ensured
  - strict positivity of inductives, which you have seen in the lecture
  - having type hierarchies rather than a [Type : Type] rule
